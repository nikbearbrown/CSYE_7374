## Autonomous Learning in Games


## Course Description 

Game artificial intelligence (Game AI) is used to generate responsive, adaptive or intelligent behaviors primarily in non-player characters (NPCs) similar to human-like intelligence. Artificial intelligence has been an integral part of video games since their inception. Games need to mimic intelligent behavior to countless game characters. Bots need to be created that can play chess or go. Games should learn for player actions and adjust the difficultly to create a challenging and engaging experience for the user.  Game AI, which includes everything from simple chasing and evading, to pattern movement, to create opponents with complex tactical and strategic decisions.

With the advent of deep learning, AI is being used to create player designs and game content. These are all complex game creation problems, and the goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to tackle these with rigorous mathematical tools. 

This course covers the fundamental theory and practice implementing autonomous behavior and learning in games. Specific topics include machine learning, search, game playing, game theory, state machines, Markov decision processes, constraint satisfaction, fuzzy logic, graphical models, deep learning, generative models and logic. 

The focus is on techniques commonly used in modern games including player modeling, procedural content generation, behavior trees, interactive narrative, decision-making systems, cognitive modeling, and path planning.
